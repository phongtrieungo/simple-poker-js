## SQL

## Poker application

### Description
The small application will have a simple UI

1. A button `CREATE DECK` to create a new deck
2. A button `RESET GAME` to reset the game back to initial state
3. A button `DRAWS CARDS` to draws five cards each turn and evaluate it's ranking

There are two labels

1. One will show the available cards in the deck
2. Another will show the ranking value for each draw

`Unit test` will be the file `spec-runner.html` to display the report following the test cases defined in file `index.spec.js`.
The reason of UT will provide test case for all available ranking values, which cannot take time to test on the UI. You just need to open the
HTML file and the UT will be run
